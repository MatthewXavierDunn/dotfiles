# My NeoVim Setup

My NeoVim setup for hitting the ground running. Simply clone this repository and
follow the setup steps.

## Prerequisites

 - [`neovim`](https://neovim.io/) for the actual text editor.
 - [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) for terminal multiplexing.
 - [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) Rust based replacement
   for grep which is blazingly fast ðŸš€ (required for the `telescope` nvim
   plugin).

## Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. Move the contents of the `nvim` folder into your nvim config folder: `~/.config/nvim`.
3. Move the `.tmux.conf` file in the `tmux` folder into your home directory:
   `~`.
4. Install the tmux plugin manager - tpm:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
  ```
5. Run both tmux and nvim to perform the initial setup and installation of all
   specified plugins.
6. You will now have a pretty good neovim setup with tmux compatibility.
